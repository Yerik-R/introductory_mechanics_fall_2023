        "Something you worry about is that Jorginho has been eating too many Whattaburgers and has been gaining weight. He seems to be unaware that 1 calorie (or cal for short), the amount of work required to increase the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1 degree Celcius, is 4.184 Joules. He appears to be also blissfully ignorant that the food industry uses the $large$ calorie, which is equal to 1000 (regular) calories (to their credit, sometimes abbreviated as Cal rather than cal). Maybe this is why Jorginho keeps eating those Avocado Bacon Burger Whattameals, which contain 1650 Cal $=$ 1,650,000 cal $\\approx$ 7 million Joules."

        "Unable to stop him from eating Whattameals, in the past few weeks, the profesionals at your company Physics Physical LLC have gone into damage control and have started experimenting with the incline during Jorginho's treadmilll runs in order to make him do some extra work (literally). The program is described below. Photographic evidence of the calories 'burned' is located [here](https://github.com/jamunozlab/introductory_mechanics_fall_2022/blob/main/projects/Ph_2320_P3_data.ipynb) and is summarized below. The speed does not affect the amount of work done, only how quickly it will get done.
